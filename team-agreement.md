Group Members: Kiengchay Gomez, Joshua Hahn, Brandon Lewis Ruiz, Jelani (Jaye) Rhinehart

## Cooperation Plan
Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

Describe at least:

### What are the key strengths of each person on the team? 

Brandon's strength is flexibility. Joshua's strength is presentation. Jaye's strength is problem-solving. Kiengchay's strength is creativity. 

### How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project? 

Joshua will use his strength to be our project presenter. Brandon will be the one to add finishing touches on the project. Kiengchay can help make the project interesting and Jaye will utilize her strength to help debug and brainstorm.

### In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

Joshua and Jaye would both love to develop more software logic and expand their knowledge. Kiengchay wants to work on her presentation skills. Brandon wants to increase his skills in back-end languages.

### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

Start off with a team meeting, review what's done, what still needs to be completed, plan for avoiding gituations, communicate what each of us is working on. 

NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.


## Conflict Plan
Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:

### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises? 

Majority rules on conflicts, simultaneous vote count. 

### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

Openly communicate when feeling a lack of input on a project.

### How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

We will implement a mob-style programming to help each other understand the code better, and we will rotate who is writing the code.

### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

We will have an intervention.

### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

If it's too challenging, we will bring in the instructor to mediate.

## Communication Plan
Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

Describe at least:

### What hours will you be available to communicate? 

Mainly during class, and Slack if outside of class hours.

### What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

Slack. If Slack is unavailable, then communicate via email. 

### How often will you take breaks?

At least once every hour for ten minutes, or as needed.

### What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

Open communication to everyone, and we will share the workload as a team to catch up. Everyone on the team is pretty flexible.

### How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

Slack

### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

Intentionally checking in with individual group members and making sure everyone is providing input/feedback.

### How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

BE NICE. 

## Work Plan
Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

Describe at least:

### How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

We are going to utilize Trello to identify, assign, check status, and manage our tasks.

### What project management tool will be used?

Trello

## Presentation Deck
Make a single copy of the Presentation Deck Template. Share your copy will all team members, so everyone is working from the same file.

Link to the shared doc in your project plan.


## Schedule your practice session
Work with your instructor to pre-schedule an date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.

Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:

Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”

## Git Process
Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

Describe at least:

### What components of your project will live on GitHub?

All of it will be on the team's repo with the exception of the presentation deck which will be on google docs.

### How will you share the repository with your teammates?

We started an organization in GitHub so everyone has access to the repo.

### What is your Git flow?

Everyone will be working on their own branch and during a mob-style programming we will work on a specific branch. Before we start the day, everyone will do a git pull from main.

### Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:

During mob-style, we will PR/merge as a group. During pair programming, we will have the other pair review PR and merge.

### How many people must review a PR?

at least 2

### Who merges PRs?

We will do that as a group.

### How often will you merge?

Once we complete a feature.

### How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?

Group meeting or ring a bell.
