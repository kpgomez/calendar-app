## What pain point does this project solve?

This project solves daily scheduling.

## Why should we care about your product?

This is a tool that can help keep you on time for meetings, boost your productivity, and help you achieve your goals. This is a product that can change lives and get people moving towards their goals. Calendars can help people reduce anxiety by getting their ideas out of their head and onto an app that will remind them about appointments or what they were going to be doing on Friday night.

## Scope (In/Out)

### IN - What will your product do

- Our product will display at least one month (April 2023) where a user can click on any day of the month and then add or remove tasks for that day. 
- There will also be a to-do panel on the side where a user can add or remove tasks they want to get done on no particular day. 

### OUT - What will your product not do.
These should be features that you will make very clear from the beginning that you will not do during development. These should be limited and very few. Pick your battles wisely. This should only be 1 or 2 things. Example: My website will never turn into an IOS or Android app.

- Our product will not sync across multiple devices
- It will also not integrate with other calendars
