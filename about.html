    <h2>Jelani (Jaye) Rhinehart</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Jelani Rhinehart. My goal is to become a software developer. I've always had an interest in technology and got into computer science as an early teenager. I began to teach myself some basic programming on Codecademy when I was 13 and then went to a STEM high school. After high school, I knew I wanted to continue coding. I pursued computer science at both the University of Washington and the
      University of Texas, but then heard about Code Fellows and decided to go for certification. In the future, I envision myself publishing mobile applications that can be released both in the Google Play store and the App Store and creating some of my own APIs that people can use.</p>
